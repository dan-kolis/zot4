<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A fundamental biological challenge is to understand how the information encoded by the
metagenome of an organism is processed to produce the resulting behaviors and phenotypes.
Simply: genes, made up of DNA, are transcribed into RNA, and translated into proteins
which together form the vast majority of functional elements in an organism. Evolutionary
processes ensure that these functional elements interact with their environment in a
manner that is beneficial to the organism, using a variety of organic (mostly) and
inorganic molecules to catalyse reactions, recognise cellular signals, build
cellular structures and pathways, and to perform a host of other diverse biological
functions.</p>
<p>Our research elucidates these processes by developing computational algorithms to
model, annotate, and understand the relationships among and between the sequences,
structures, functions, and interactions of proteins, DNA, RNA, and metabolites,
from atoms and molecules to systems and proteomes, in the context of their
environments. The goal is to develop a coherent picture of the mechanistic
basis (interconnectedness) of molecular and organismal structure, function, networks,
and evolution within a fundamental scientific framework.</p>
<p>We model interactomics at an atomic level by algorithmic approaches as well as by
inferring homology (as we have done for the rice proteome and are actively doing
for the proteomes from 1000 plants), a subset of which is the CANDO compound-proteome
3D interaction matrix, two applications of which are drug discovery and nanobiotechnology.</p>
<p>Our goals are to develop novel methods and apply them in the following areas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Structure: Predict atomic level three dimensional structures of biologically important molecules (such as proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules with emphasis on proteins) given their linear chemical structure (sequence).</p></li>
<li><p>Function: Predict function using the resulting models with the aid of existing experimental information.</p></li>
<li><p>Interaction: Predict interactions between and among these molecules, including biological substrates and inhibitors.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems: Predict the behaviour of pathways, systems, and whole cells by integrating the structure, function, and interaction information with the expression (copy number) of these molecules.</p></li>
<li><p>Evolution: Study the evolution of these biological molecules to ask and answer questions on the origin of, and the conditions necessary to nurture, life.</p></li>
<li><p>Design: Design novel biological entities not observed in nature using our predictive methodologies and verify the designed constructs at the bench.</p></li>
<li><p>Application: Apply the methodologies developed to study specific biological problems of interest in the areas of medicine and nanotechnology.</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure: Develop an infrastructure to publish the integrated information so that it is useful for biologists to pose and answer precise scientific questions about molecular, systems and organismal biology.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More detailed information on these methods are available as part of our ongoing research
and also our list of publications.</p>

<h2>Implications<a class="headerlink" href="#implications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We expect that research into these different bioinformatics disciplines will enable to
provide a comprehensive mapping and understanding how organismal genomes specify
phenotype in particular environments. This information will enable us to probe that
organism's molecular, cellular, and physiological pathways with an exquisite degree
of sensitivity and also help us understand and treat infectious, neoplastic,
and inherited disease in an increasingly efficient and rational manner. The development
of algorithms and tools to understand organismal genomes and proteomes will have
practical utility for pharmacogenomics and genetic engineering, and will be
of use to the general research community to pose and answer ever more precise
biological questions. <strong>Specifically, one of the major applications of our research
is precision shotgun drug discovery and repurposing using virtual cell multiscale
models for disease diagnosis and intervention.</strong></p>
<p>Understanding organismal biology from a genomic and proteomic perspective requires
expertise in several scientific disciplines, including computing science, mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology. The problems that need to be solved generally
involve exploration of large search spaces and finding objects of interest within
those spaces, as well as managing the large amount of data produced and making
predictions from analysis of the data. Thus our research has significance in not
only answering biological questions, but is also relevant for solving problems of
a similar nature in other scientific disciplines.</p>
