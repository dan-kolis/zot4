<span id="aboutsphinx1"></span><h2>About Sphinx<a class="headerlink" href="#about-sphinx" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Sphinx is a <strong>documentation generator</strong>;
in which human readable text can be compiled to create various published kinds of output
sets. Its is written in Python, and any operating system that can run Python 3.X correctly
can convert prepared files to ready to publish sets created with one click.
A specific functionality of interest to everyone is making HTML for WWW browser communication.
LaTeX is a non-trivial second output  possibility, usually rendered somewhat indirectly to
make a PDF file for each publishing project.</p>
<p>Sphinx converts <strong>reStructuredText</strong> into the outputs; (visualize HTML for the moment),
These input files by convention have an 'extension' of .rst. There is a one to one
correspondence between .rst inputs and .HTML files; but support involves hundreds of files
to support a built in search engine and a navigation system. The output is ready for a single
point of contact with a server program like Apache. This usual top level interface point
begins as file: <strong>index.html</strong>, which is exactly the usual expectation for distribution on
internet.</p>
<p>Images are supported perfectly well, and embedded WWW experiences like video can be configured
with a little focused effort, using IFRAMES, or RAW, two ways to extend Sphinx without
'real' Python programming and the effort to integrate it.</p>
<p><strong>My opinion regarding extensions of functionality:</strong> is that there is no compelling reason
to turn every publishing project into a parallel software support project. A simple setting
of some <strong>single global variable</strong> to TRUE pr FALSE and reading and <strong>applying the directions
carefully</strong> can do 99% of anything rational, with absolutely no programming whatsoever.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enabling-features-and-comments-about-extensions">
<span id="morefeatures"></span><h2>Enabling features and comments about extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#enabling-features-and-comments-about-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using the markdown language of <strong>reStructuredText</strong> files, Sphinx is extensible by hooking
new features in via Python libraries. <strong>Extensions</strong>, for example – improve the functionality
for exports for documentation of computer programs from base source code, and the rendering
of even the most obscure mathematical notations, (to name two scoped fields of enhancement).</p>
<p>A single file tucked in with the .rst set file: <strong>conf.py</strong> is small but very important.
Huge pieces of functionality are turned <strong>off</strong> by default, but can be enabled by changing
a single variable's values to True from either non-existence, or a default setting of False.</p>
<p>This file is <em>not</em> read as a file by the Sphinx program, it's suddenly part of the executable
itself. Some options involve, for instance, setting dictionary elements to global constants.
However, simply setting a predefined variable name to True or False, is by far the most common
control point to enable a line item of functionality.</p>
<p>Many Book-specific concepts like sections, chapters and footnotes are supported without
requiring extensions; and even glossaries and other lexicons of various kinds are enabled
by setting Sphinx to make JSON files to enable these possibilities.</p>
<p>Versioning and display of authorship for each .rst file is an interesting switchable
functionality. A fine; <strong>'ready to go' without extension</strong>, capability.
And even more control is available with some Python add-in's along these lines.</p>
<p>Non existence or incorrect placement of this file is a serious problem. If it is not found,
the package will not produce results. The error message on TTY is:</p>
<p class="centered">
<strong><strong>Application error: config directory doesn't contain a conf.py file</strong></strong></p><div class="section" id="the-official-documentation-is-a-bit-weird">
<span id="docw1"></span><h3>The Official documentation is a bit weird<a class="headerlink" href="#the-official-documentation-is-a-bit-weird" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>'Official'</strong> documentation seems oddly hard to actually use.</p>
<p>This HUMAN READABLE worked example is a single file, showing only things that
<strong>WORK 100% in each how-to chunk of knowledge</strong>; Each with a (hopefully), clear explanation.</p>
<p>The file: <strong>Using_sphing_worked_examples</strong> is the .rst and presumably the same named HTML and/or
other output rendering.
You will want to look at <strong>the code itself</strong>, along with what it produces, here.</p>
<p class="centered">
<strong><strong>Don't look at the output alone. Look at what made it.</strong></strong></p><p>This specific reference is the best I found for usability, Many other's are somewhat misleading:

<p>The mix of different syntaxes and importance of whitespace makes it frustrating to try for
each visual effect the first time you attempt it.
Cut and paste of the <strong>actual text that created this worked example</strong>, is much more productive
then a protracted cycle of Google searches.</p>

<p>Instructions will tell your about <strong>Docutils</strong> which is a markdown notation that existed long before
Sphinx. This is basically about a fat library of Python that is called for <strong>some,
but not all</strong> markdown / markup.</p>

<span id="termessent11"></span><h3>More terminology essentials<a class="headerlink" href="#more-terminology-essentials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>reStructuredText</strong> is the slight upgrade to <strong>Docutils</strong> markup and it's abbreviated <strong>reST</strong>.
Don't be too worried about it, Remember if something is ignored, the file: <strong>conf.py</strong> often
turns on and off the function that does not do what you expect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="heads-up-about-toctree">
<span id="headsup1"></span><h3>Heads up ! About toctree<a class="headerlink" href="#heads-up-about-toctree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you're maintaining an existing publishing project, perhaps you do not need to understand the
tricky <strong>toctree</strong> keyword completely.
The scope of this keyword is how propagation of headings and creation of the table of contents
is controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Even if your work is extensive</strong>, copying and editing what is begun; Is best. Any change to this
means almost certainly a visit to <strong>every human readable file in the project</strong> and is an undefined
commitment in time.</p>
<p>Generally, the toctree 'just do it' magic is kicked in at the start of conversion alone; In the
file: <strong>index.rst</strong>.
Scattering <em>toctree</em> in other files will make the index content crazy, not better.
<strong>Any of the many switches</strong> around it change the project quite a lot.
This is serious stuff for getting, or maintaining desired results.</p>
<p>But if you start a project 'from scratch', you will want to experiment with the <strong>toctree</strong> portion before
committing to a procedure for designing your workflow.</p>
<p>I suppose a bit of bad news is: <strong>toctree</strong> is beyond the scope of this document entirely.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="worked-examples-begin-here">
<span id="workede1"></span><h1>Worked examples begin here<a class="headerlink" href="#worked-examples-begin-here" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following material is presented roughly in the order of importance, <strong>starting with flat text</strong>
and <strong>concluding with images, lists and footnotes</strong>. <strong>What you need to know most</strong>, is first.</p>
<p>There is no other specific order whatsoever. The goal is to supply you with one file making one
HTML point of contact. The two together should enable your contribution to the documentation creation
and management process.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the actual text to do a thing is shown, other times it is hinted that a look
at the source file: <strong>Using_sphinx_worked_examples.rst</strong>, is best. This is intentional; Each
function is exposed one way or the other. The choice is based on how it's (hopefully), easiest
for you to get results with the least iterative frustration.</p>
<div class="section" id="paragraphs">
<span id="para10"></span><h2>Paragraphs<a class="headerlink" href="#paragraphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most of your file content will be flat text broken up with empty lines, marking the gap
between paragraphs. Sometimes you will want a heading as per the underlined text.</p>
<p>Sphinx literature says widths should be less then 98 chars wide, but logically the width is more
often half that and left organized for orderly editing of the ideas. Narrower is better,
so that is an abs max. UTF-8 encoding for the many <strong>.rst</strong> files, is best.</p>
<p>Double blank lines are an useful organizational concept. Like HTML and LaTeX, extra lines disappear in
HTML output entirely. Extra white space for flat text is also correctly removed in HTML output.</p>
<p>You can learn this organically by trying it 'as you go' or by adding file(s) and doing a conversion,
then look for your test file, ignoring the rest of the publishing act for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Simple:</strong> Same filename, but different extension, ( <strong>.rst to .html</strong> ).
Any file not included in the recursive gets from <strong>index.html</strong> does not earn a place in the index, but
a little poking and you will find the output it created. This is an easy way to get the look right
without thinking about the project in its entirety. Just hack at one file making one piece of HTML
until your ready to make that appear, typically by adding it to file: <strong>index.rst</strong> of course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comments">
<span id="comments1"></span><h2>Comments<a class="headerlink" href="#comments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Comments begin at the left margin; then two spaces, two periods, a space and any text; like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">.. This is a comment. It does not show up in the converted output.</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Various reuses of the markdown benefit from TWO spaces, not just ONE, though most things that need whitespace
seem to work with one. Worked examples in 'official' documents use two spaces for fancy whitespace.
That is, whitespace usee to trigger commands and formatting. Since embedded paragraphs need exact matching,
spaces are a bit deal to Sphinx.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>no tabs as syntax elements</strong> please.
The <strong>reST</strong> spec says:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>&quot; <strong>Spaces are recommended for indentation, but tabs may also be used.
Tabs will be converted to spaces. Tab stops are at every 8th column</strong> &quot;</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#whitespace">http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#whitespace</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Formal documents seem to chat up 3 spaces, but most of the stuff seems to use two. This
applies to commands and calls to the styling, for regular text of course; A space is a space !</p>
<p>Embedded program examples with tabs are a special case. Maybe tabs are ok in those, try it and decide
if the wide space equiv looks strange. This issue would certainly complicate reuse in LaTeX too.</p>
<blockquote>
<div></div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="internal-to-project-jump-to-clickable-points">
<span id="toproj1"></span><h2>Internal to project jump to clickable points<a class="headerlink" href="#internal-to-project-jump-to-clickable-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to jump to any heading in your published work with a <strong>ref</strong> command, and all the details
like going back with direction arrows, and scrolling are handled perfectly. This example is about
<strong>Points defined by headings in the project, in any .rst file</strong>. Jumps to http are similar, but not
identical.</p>
<p>Heading text as jump to <strong>labels</strong> are <strong>sort of</strong> usable as targets; But if there duplicated,
then the conversion process doesn't know <strong>which one</strong> is the intended target.
Marking a <strong>jump to point</strong> with a unique name makes it a <strong>label</strong>. This is usually worth the time it
takes. There is no liability having an unused label. If you are sure the file needs no or very little
hopping around, you can decide to just ignore adding labels to headings, but keep it in mind for work
likely to be maintained 'forever', or for complex works where jumping around is usually indicated
sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>I find proofreading is simplified</strong> to having a known 'look at me for editing' label point open in
both a browser and editor anyway. The command to use the click hop point is exactly the same whether
it's an added in label or pulled from the flat text of the heading itself.</p>
<dl>
<dt>To create a label in the text before any heading, use this syntax:</dt><dd><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">.. _elephant13:</div>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oddly perhaps, you need an empty line before and after the label line, or it will be ignored.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Then, any number of the <strong>ref</strong> keyword(s) can be placed anywhere in the project, like so`:</dt><dd><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">:ref:`elephant13`</div>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The conversion shows you have a malformed entry by <strong>coloring the entry funny</strong>, and not supplying the
target text.
..
To see the <strong>label ref pair</strong> really work, just search for <strong>para10</strong> and see this jump point in the source.
Here it is working:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#para10"><span class="std std-ref">Paragraphs</span></a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-note-box">
<span id="anote1"></span><h2>A note box<a class="headerlink" href="#a-note-box" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some dressy content formatting is very easy to generate, like this box of information with a title.
Different colors for titles look great, all carefully ready to go:</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This is a note.
It is some multiline of flat text starting with 2 spaces in the source after the command name.
If it's long, the program figures out how to break it,
center it, whatever it takes to make it look 'just so'.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-warning-box">
<span id="warning1"></span><h2>A warning box<a class="headerlink" href="#a-warning-box" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Warning, as in: 'do not do this', stuff:</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>This is a warning.
There are many so called admonitions like this. Here is a list of them all:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="admonitions">
<span id="admon1"></span><h2>Admonitions<a class="headerlink" href="#admonitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Just substitute this keywork for the kind of box you want, and you will get a colored entry
like the above with a different title</p>
<table class="hlist"><tr><td><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dingo</p></li>
<li><p>short items</p></li>
<li><p>that should be</p></li>
<li><p>displayed</p></li>
</ul>
</td><td><ul class="simple">
<li><p>horizontally</p></li>
<li><p>sorts out nicely</p></li>
<li><p>attention</p></li>

</td></tr></table>
<p>That horizontal self spacing construct is called a <strong>hlist</strong>. It is explained a little further down in
this worked example file. Note its often just right to dress up a list you might be tempted to render
as a table. Trying to <em>get away with</em> the simplest syntax that does the job, is efficient.</p>

<span id="pagetitle1"></span><h2>Heading special marks for lines around the text<a class="headerlink" href="#heading-special-marks-for-lines-around-the-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The hierarchy for what is called h1 to h6 headings in HTML involves using certain characters,
such that a size is associated with a character.
<strong>A bit of a scrap paper note</strong> might help you as you work, or just commit them to memory.
Using them inconsistently will make funny looking headings, which will require correction
or just look funny forever. The largest to smallest marking characters are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>====== Largest, most important</p>
<p>----- Next most important heading category</p>
<p>+++++ Next down</p>
<p>**** Down again</p>
<p>~~~~~ Smallest</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The underline can be <strong>wider</strong> then the text it decorates, but <strong>not</strong> narrower.
When used both above and below, its count must 'match exactly' or will result in errors,
and weird rendering. I usually pick three carefully for a project and use them consistently,
as opposed to overthinking 1 of 6 for every little entry.</p>

<span id="samep1"></span><h2>Simplest link to a same page heading<a class="headerlink" href="#simplest-link-to-a-same-page-heading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All the material about labels and <strong>ref</strong> might leave you unsure about the simplest case.
Here it is, a clickable reference which pulls the title for a same file heading.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#paragraphs"><span class="std std-ref">Paragraphs</span></a></p>
<p>But to make links try harder to find where to go, this change (below), is worth doing.
If you inherit a working project, its probably already done, but if not, here is how to do it;
A one line change:</p>
<div class="highlight-c notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>extensions = [ &#39;sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel&#39; ]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Some note(s) in the documentation say: &quot;Your version may do this differently&quot;.
But probably that line can't hurt. AGAIN !  A common reason to have any example not work is the
absence of a fact or assignment in file: <strong>conf.py</strong> which must be in the ./source directory
with your text to be converted.</p>
<div class="section" id="going-to-a-link-local-in-this-case-with-a-custom-description">

<p>It's easy to have a a click to point with custom text instead of pulling the heading text itself.
Like this one, going to <strong>Paragraph</strong> like the previous example, but this has its own description.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#paragraphs"><span class="std std-ref">About paragraphs for small skunks in the woods</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Most of these commands require <strong>backtick</strong> not a single quote.
That is a backtick for both leading and trailing mark. Also, adding or deleting spaces
between the lexical elements frequently destroys the functionality of the instruction
totally.</p>

<span id="extlink1"></span><h2>Links to an external URL<a class="headerlink" href="#links-to-an-external-url" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because hypertext is so important, its not surprising a package like this has all
sorts of variations to make a URL clickable. You should look at this as source code level, probably.
First a URL without a local description:</p>
<p>&lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hatbox.com/">http://www.hatbox.com/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>And next, with a re-written description:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://cnn.com">A funny news Network</a></p>
<p>Note the funny use of an underscore. Also a space is required right before the opening &lt; mark.</p>
<p>Next, an inline with text URL &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-ferrets-make-good-pets-1236788">http://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-ferrets-make-good-pets-1236788</a>&gt; HEY, we
all know how much fun Ferrets can be around the house.</p>
<p><em>Next</em>, a renamed inline hyperlink: <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack IS Overflowing</a> is a source of information,
both excellent and terrible.</p>
<p>Here is a source of how to information about less common URL access possibilities.
Examples of this include: Facilities to have a cache, renaming of 'links' to make internal lexicons of
URLs, and testing to detect dead links:</p>
<p>&lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html">https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html</a>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even if the server is known to only support <strong>https</strong> I suggest you use <strong>http</strong>
in the call(s). The multi-pass handshaking will upgrade the crypto better then any hand doodling.
It will figure out 80 versus 443 and the right crypto. If you are accidentally leaving your session content
un-encrypted, the fix is on the server side, no here at the client...</p>

<p>The next obvious visual concept to consider is adding color for text, and maybe horizontal lines

<p>A subdirectory exists in most of these releases, in <strong>./source</strong> named <strong>addingcolor</strong> with how
to do that.</p>
<p>Note that formal documents generally do not, (and should not), <strong>require</strong> color to be usable.
Making the 'system', work with color formally, involves stabilizing it as a system, because it
involves add in pieces.  So if there isn't quite a commitment to doing that, its better to avoid
it almost entirely for the moment; Rather then make construction of a little IDE more complex
for what is not essential.</p>
<p>The subdirectory is there for a reason... to enable the possibility with (hopefully),
ease. So hack away if you like, but don't drag in a requirement for a frill.</p>

<div><p>I would rather see a B &amp; W image (instead of one with a little color),

course, a fussy label line needs inclusion in the .rst too. I wanted it recorded here as an enabling
thing to be known, that it's doable, its easy, and just works.</p>
<p>But it drags in a vast array of subsidiary issues; it's premature to rely on it, so its counterproductive
to do without scoping a decision about who does what where, Id's etc and that is a lot to tangle up
a first instance of a system. Look up the variable in a google search with <strong>Sphinx</strong> and try it if you like.</p>
