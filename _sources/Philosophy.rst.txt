  <h2>Group philosophies</h2>


These philosophies and more are expounded on the CompBio wiki.

I consider all of us as students of science. Every student in our group has a great 
deal of freedom to pursue projects of interest to them and are not asked to do things 
they don't want to do (except in pursuit of the larger goal of doing science, 
i.e., rigourous controls are necessary to do good science, for example). 
Unlike most other professions, the goal in our academic programme is to foster independent
problem solving abilities. I'm also a strongly antiauthoritarian and the beauty of 
science is to never believe in yourself or your ideas too much and always be highly self
critical and questioning. As such, our group is run as a structured 
anarchy ("Structured chaos", "complexity", or "edge of chaos" are all terms that 
describe some of the science we do, much like life itself, and we also study how 
models like these are among the most efficient and effective). 
I however expect, as a condition of working together, that students 
recognise that "with great freedom comes great responsibility" (made famous by 
who?). One of those responsibilities is to leave the group significantly more 
learnt (learned) and wiser, surpassing everyone's expectations, including their own 
as well those of their mentor(s). The fact that students in our group have done so 
is one of the reasons for their success.

As a mentor, I believe in fostering an environment where each student's dreams and 
potential can be fulfilled to the maximum extent possible. While I am passionate about 
doing great science I also put the interests of the people who work with me above my own. 
I value the intellectual and personal relationships I have with my students extremely 
highly and I consider myself highly fortunate to be part of a group that not only 
does great science, but makes it a pleasure to do so.

More generally, I see the reason to do great science as not only personal but also 
as an existential responsibility. I believe that "science is the greatest achievement 
so far of the human race and its long term best hope for it's survival and 
enlightenment." As organisms on this planet who consume more than they produce, 
I see this as a way to restore the equilibrium.

On a more personal level, a close knit group is almost like a family. 
Not everyone has to agree. Disagreements are encouraged, but we need to end up working 
together in the end to achieve our common goals. If you felt a sense of excitement 
and passion when you first read this and continue to feel it, then keep at it! 
The rest will follow. If you think you that you could use a reboot, then by all 
means use all means at your disposal in the group to reboot.

Finally, even though I use the word "science", I don't see it as being distinct 
from philosophy or art or other categorisations of fields of learning. 
Constantly attempting to falsify one's discoveries is science. Our niche is that 
we do computational science, i.e., computational experiments that are well designed and 
rigourously controlled in a computational laboratory. (For us, a set of one or 
more computers is a system that we call a laboratory; our group therefore is referred 
to as just that, a "group", not a "lab" or a "laboratory".)
