Using Sphinx - Worked examples
=====================================

About Sphinx
--------------
  Sphinx is a **documentation generator**; 
  in which human readable text can be compiled to create various published kinds of output
  sets. Its is written in Python, and any operating system that can run Python 3.X correctly
  can convert prepared files to ready to publish sets created with one click. 
  A specific functionality of interest to everyone is making HTML for WWW browser communication. 
  LaTeX is a non-trivial second output  possibility, usually rendered somewhat indirectly to 
  make a PDF file for each publishing project.

  Sphinx converts **reStructuredText** into the outputs; (visualize HTML for the moment), 
  These input files by convention have an 'extension' of .rst. There is a one to one
  correspondence between .rst inputs and .HTML files; but support involves hundreds of files
  to support a built in search engine and a navigation system. The output is ready for a single
  point of contact with a server program like Apache. This usual top level interface point
  begins as file: **index.html**, which is exactly the usual expectation for distribution on
  internet.

  Images are supported perfectly well, and embedded WWW experiences like video can be configured
  with a little focused effort, using IFRAMES, or RAW, two ways to extend Sphinx without
  'real' Python programming and the effort to integrate it.

  **My opinion regarding extensions of functionality:** is that there is no compelling reason 
  to turn every publishing project into a parallel software support project. A simple setting 
  of some **single global variable** to TRUE pr FALSE and reading and **applying the directions 
  carefully** can do 99% of anything rational, with absolutely no programming whatsoever.


.. _morefeatures:

Enabling features and comments about extensions
--------------------------------------------------
Using the markdown language of **reStructuredText** files, Sphinx is extensible by hooking
new features in via Python libraries. **Extensions**, for example – improve the functionality 
for exports for documentation of computer programs from base source code, and the rendering 
of even the most obscure mathematical notations, (to name two scoped fields of enhancement). 

A single file tucked in with the .rst set file: **conf.py** is small but very important.
Huge pieces of functionality are turned **off** by default, but can be enabled by changing
a single variable's values to True from either non-existence, or a default setting of False.

This file is *not* read as a file by the Sphinx program, it's suddenly part of the executable
itself. Some options involve, for instance, setting dictionary elements to global constants.
However, simply setting a predefined variable name to True or False, is by far the most common
control point to enable a line item of functionality.

Many Book-specific concepts like sections, chapters and footnotes are supported without 
requiring extensions; and even glossaries and other lexicons of various kinds are enabled 
by setting Sphinx to make JSON files to enable these possibilities.

Versioning and display of authorship for each .rst file is an interesting switchable
functionality. A fine; **'ready to go' without extension**, capability. 
And even more control is available with some Python add-in's along these lines.

Non existence or incorrect placement of this file is a serious problem. If it is not found,
the package will not produce results. The error message on TTY is:

.. centered::
  **Application error: config directory doesn't contain a conf.py file**


.. _docw1:

The Official documentation is a bit weird
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The **'Official'** documentation seems oddly hard to actually use. 

This HUMAN READABLE worked example is a single file, showing only things that 
**WORK 100% in each how-to chunk of knowledge**; Each with a (hopefully), clear explanation. 

The file: **Using_sphing_worked_examples** is the .rst and presumably the same named HTML and/or
other output rendering.
You will want to look at **the code itself**, along with what it produces, here. 

.. centered::
  **Don't look at the output alone. Look at what made it.**

This specific reference is the best I found for usability, Many other's are somewhat misleading:
<http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/openalea/doc/_build/html/source/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>


.. _cfriend11:

Copy and paste is your friend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mix of different syntaxes and importance of whitespace makes it frustrating to try for 
each visual effect the first time you attempt it.
Cut and paste of the **actual text that created this worked example**, is much more productive 
then a protracted cycle of Google searches.


.. _terminology1:

Important terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instructions will tell your about **Docutils** which is a markdown notation that existed long before
Sphinx. This is basically about a fat library of Python that is called for **some, 
but not all** markdown / markup. 


.. _termessent11: 

More terminology essentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**reStructuredText** is the slight upgrade to **Docutils** markup and it's abbreviated **reST**.
Don't be too worried about it, Remember if something is ignored, the file: **conf.py** often
turns on and off the function that does not do what you expect.


.. _headsup1:

Heads up ! About toctree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're maintaining an existing publishing project, perhaps you do not need to understand the 
tricky **toctree** keyword completely. 
The scope of this keyword is how propagation of headings and creation of the table of contents 
is controlled. 

**Even if your work is extensive**, copying and editing what is begun; Is best. Any change to this
means almost certainly a visit to **every human readable file in the project** and is an undefined 
commitment in time.

Generally, the toctree 'just do it' magic is kicked in at the start of conversion alone; In the
file: **index.rst**.
Scattering *toctree* in other files will make the index content crazy, not better. 
**Any of the many switches** around it change the project quite a lot. 
This is serious stuff for getting, or maintaining desired results.

But if you start a project 'from scratch', you will want to experiment with the **toctree** portion before
committing to a procedure for designing your workflow. 

I suppose a bit of bad news is: **toctree** is beyond the scope of this document entirely.


.. _workede1:

=========================================
Worked examples begin here
=========================================
The following material is presented roughly in the order of importance, **starting with flat text** 
and **concluding with images, lists and footnotes**. **What you need to know most**, is first.

There is no other specific order whatsoever. The goal is to supply you with one file making one 
HTML point of contact. The two together should enable your contribution to the documentation creation
and management process.

Sometimes, the actual text to do a thing is shown, other times it is hinted that a look
at the source file: **Using_sphinx_worked_examples.rst**, is best. This is intentional; Each
function is exposed one way or the other. The choice is based on how it's (hopefully), easiest 
for you to get results with the least iterative frustration.


.. _para10:

Paragraphs
----------
Most of your file content will be flat text broken up with empty lines, marking the gap
between paragraphs. Sometimes you will want a heading as per the underlined text. 

Sphinx literature says widths should be less then 98 chars wide, but logically the width is more
often half that and left organized for orderly editing of the ideas. Narrower is better, 
so that is an abs max. UTF-8 encoding for the many **.rst** files, is best.

Double blank lines are an useful organizational concept. Like HTML and LaTeX, extra lines disappear in
HTML output entirely. Extra white space for flat text is also correctly removed in HTML output.

You can learn this organically by trying it 'as you go' or by adding file(s) and doing a conversion, 
then look for your test file, ignoring the rest of the publishing act for the moment.  

**Simple:** Same filename, but different extension, ( **.rst to .html** ). 
Any file not included in the recursive gets from **index.html** does not earn a place in the index, but
a little poking and you will find the output it created. This is an easy way to get the look right 
without thinking about the project in its entirety. Just hack at one file making one piece of HTML
until your ready to make that appear, typically by adding it to file: **index.rst** of course.


.. _comments1:

Comments
--------
Comments begin at the left margin; then two spaces, two periods, a space and any text; like this:

 |  .. This is a comment. It does not show up in the converted output. 

Various reuses of the markdown benefit from TWO spaces, not just ONE, though most things that need whitespace
seem to work with one. Worked examples in 'official' documents use two spaces for fancy whitespace.
That is, whitespace usee to trigger commands and formatting. Since embedded paragraphs need exact matching,
spaces are a bit deal to Sphinx.

Also, **no tabs as syntax elements** please. 
The **reST** spec says:
    " **Spaces are recommended for indentation, but tabs may also be used. 
    Tabs will be converted to spaces. Tab stops are at every 8th column** "

    http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#whitespace

Formal documents seem to chat up 3 spaces, but most of the stuff seems to use two. This
applies to commands and calls to the styling, for regular text of course; A space is a space !

Embedded program examples with tabs are a special case. Maybe tabs are ok in those, try it and decide
if the wide space equiv looks strange. This issue would certainly complicate reuse in LaTeX too.

.. _toproj1:

Internal to project jump to clickable points
----------------------------------------------
It is possible to jump to any heading in your published work with a **ref** command, and all the details
like going back with direction arrows, and scrolling are handled perfectly. This example is about
**Points defined by headings in the project, in any .rst file**. Jumps to http are similar, but not 
identical.

Heading text as jump to **labels** are **sort of** usable as targets; But if there duplicated, 
then the conversion process doesn't know **which one** is the intended target. 
Marking a **jump to point** with a unique name makes it a **label**. This is usually worth the time it 
takes. There is no liability having an unused label. If you are sure the file needs no or very little
hopping around, you can decide to just ignore adding labels to headings, but keep it in mind for work
likely to be maintained 'forever', or for complex works where jumping around is usually indicated
sooner or later.

**I find proofreading is simplified** to having a known 'look at me for editing' label point open in 
both a browser and editor anyway. The command to use the click hop point is exactly the same whether 
it's an added in label or pulled from the flat text of the heading itself.

To create a label in the text before any heading, use this syntax:
 | .. _elephant13:

Oddly perhaps, you need an empty line before and after the label line, or it will be ignored.

Then, any number of the **ref** keyword(s) can be placed anywhere in the project, like so`:
 | \:ref\:\`elephant13\`

The conversion shows you have a malformed entry by **coloring the entry funny**, and not supplying the
target text. 
..
To see the **label ref pair** really work, just search for **para10** and see this jump point in the source.
Here it is working:

:ref:`para10`


.. _anote1:

A note box
-------------------------------
Some dressy content formatting is very easy to generate, like this box of information with a title.
Different colors for titles look great, all carefully ready to go:

.. note::
  This is a note.
  It is some multiline of flat text starting with 2 spaces in the source after the command name. 
  If it's long, the program figures out how to break it, 
  center it, whatever it takes to make it look 'just so'.


.. _warning1:

A warning box
------------------
Warning, as in: 'do not do this', stuff:

.. warning::
  This is a warning.
  There are many so called admonitions like this. Here is a list of them all:


.. _admon1:

Admonitions
------------
Just substitute this keywork for the kind of box you want, and you will get a colored entry 
like the above with a different title


.. hlist::
  :columns: 5

  * Dingo
  * short items
  * that should be
  * displayed
  * horizontally
  * sorts out nicely
  * attention 
  * caution
  * danger
  * error
  * hint
  * important
  * note
  * tip
  * warning
  * title

That horizontal self spacing construct is called a **hlist**. It is explained a little further down in
this worked example file. Note its often just right to dress up a list you might be tempted to render
as a table. Trying to *get away with* the simplest syntax that does the job, is efficient.


.. _someline1:

Some in line text effects
--------------------------------
In line text changes entries just a little. Two are STRONG and EMPHASIS, like this example.

  Hey you ! said the :strong:`big dogs friend` with the :emphasis:`fancy eyebrows`.

Please look at the source code. Note these require **backtick** not **single quote"".


.. _ablock1:

A code block
---------------
Quoted hunk of code have a specific way for presentation. Note there is a *style hint* naming
the language, which handles some stuff like comments and whitespace. This is listed as 'c' 
for this example.

.. code-block:: c

  This is a so called Code block. It's like note a lot, but it adds a kind of language hint.
  Maybe indenting helps.
    int z = 5;

    z = z + 5;
    string yup = "test";


.. _addingunicode1:

Adding Unicode chars
--------------------
Adding copyright symbol and the Euro is explained reasonably well here:
<https://docs.anaconda.com/restructuredtext/detailed/>

Look for "unicode", it's somewhat buried in some other concept generally.


.. _embedded1:

Embedded text tweaks
----------------------------------------
Text can be ordained with touch up like this:
Asterisks one and two do this: *I am one* and **I am Two**
The first one is italics, the second is bold.


.. _indp1:

Indented paragraphs
----------------------------

This is just left margined two lines, this is one.
This is two.

But this is multiple indents
  Two for me.
  More two for me.
    Four for me now.

      " Quotes might help sometimes, or just more drums "
      - Buddy Guy


.. _pagetitle1:

Heading special marks for lines around the text
-------------------------------------------------
The hierarchy for what is called h1 to h6 headings in HTML involves using certain characters,
such that a size is associated with a character.
**A bit of a scrap paper note** might help you as you work, or just commit them to memory. 
Using them inconsistently will make funny looking headings, which will require correction
or just look funny forever. The largest to smallest marking characters are:

  \=\=\=\=\=\= Largest, most important

  ----- Next most important heading category

  +++++ Next down

  \*\*\*\* Down again 

  ~~~~~ Smallest

The underline can be **wider** then the text it decorates, but **not** narrower.
When used both above and below, its count must 'match exactly' or will result in errors,
and weird rendering. I usually pick three carefully for a project and use them consistently,
as opposed to overthinking 1 of 6 for every little entry. 


.. _samep1:

Simplest link to a same page heading
---------------------------------------
All the material about labels and **ref** might leave you unsure about the simplest case.
Here it is, a clickable reference which pulls the title for a same file heading. 

:ref:`Paragraphs`

But to make links try harder to find where to go, this change (below), is worth doing. 
If you inherit a working project, its probably already done, but if not, here is how to do it;
A one line change:

.. code-block:: c

  extensions = [ 'sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel' ]

Some note(s) in the documentation say: "Your version may do this differently". 
But probably that line can't hurt. AGAIN !  A common reason to have any example not work is the
absence of a fact or assignment in file: **conf.py** which must be in the ./source directory
with your text to be converted.


.. _golink1:

Going to a link ( local in this case ) with a custom description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's easy to have a a click to point with custom text instead of pulling the heading text itself.
Like this one, going to **Paragraph** like the previous example, but this has its own description. 

:ref:`About paragraphs for small skunks in the woods <Paragraphs>`

**Important:** Most of these commands require **backtick** not a single quote. 
That is a backtick for both leading and trailing mark. Also, adding or deleting spaces
between the lexical elements frequently destroys the functionality of the instruction
totally. 


.. _extlink1:

Links to an external URL
------------------------------
Because hypertext is so important, its not surprising a package like this has all 
sorts of variations to make a URL clickable. You should look at this as source code level, probably. 
First a URL without a local description:

<http://www.hatbox.com/>

And next, with a re-written description:

`A funny news Network <http://cnn.com>`_

Note the funny use of an underscore. Also a space is required right before the opening < mark.

Next, an inline with text URL <http://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-ferrets-make-good-pets-1236788> HEY, we
all know how much fun Ferrets can be around the house.

*Next*, a renamed inline hyperlink: `Stack IS Overflowing <http://stackoverflow.com/>`_ is a source of information,
both excellent and terrible.

Here is a source of how to information about less common URL access possibilities.
Examples of this include: Facilities to have a cache, renaming of 'links' to make internal lexicons of 
URLs, and testing to detect dead links:

<https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html>

**Note:** Even if the server is known to only support **https** I suggest you use **http**
in the call(s). The multi-pass handshaking will upgrade the crypto better then any hand doodling.
It will figure out 80 versus 443 and the right crypto. If you are accidentally leaving your session content
un-encrypted, the fix is on the server side, no here at the client...


.. _center1:

Centering
---------
Centering anything inherits a little of the mess from from HTML on the same subject.

.. centered::  Whoopee Golberg has fun at work

And a multi line variation:

.. centered::
  This is a multiple line thing, Its hard to decide if it is really centered correctly.
  Its important to notice and apply the spaces for indentation.

A look at the source code, as source... is probably best.


.. _fixedtext1:

More Fixed Text
----------------
Another hint for fixed horizontal space uses the virgule symbol. 
line started with a virgule, like:

    | A one, two, a one two three four
    |
    |
    | Half a bee, philosophically,
    |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
    | But half the bee has got to be,
    |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see ?


Notice even multiple CRLF are maintained, usually this is hard to achieve in HTML.


.. _orderedpairs1:

Ordered pairs
-------------
Ordered pairs can be represented with ease. Since so many computery things are this = that ideas,
this is quite useful.

:Date: 2001-08-16
:Version: 1
:Authors: - Me
          - Myself
          - I
:Indentation: Since the field may be quite long, the second
   and subsequent lines of the field body do not have to line up
   with the first line
:Parameter i: integer


.. _csvtables1:

CSV Style tables
----------------
There are about three ways to make tables. this one is interesting, 
a sort of CSV like entry:

.. csv-table:: Frozen Delights!
   :header: "Treat", "Quantity", "Description"
   :widths: 15, 10, 30

   "Albatross", 2.99, "On a stick!"
   "Crunchy Frog", 1.49, "If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be
   crunchy, now would it?"
   "Gannet Ripple", 1.99, "On a stick!"

These nice entries are at this URL: <https://runawayhorse001.github.io/SphinxGithub/rtxt.html>


.. _images1:

Images - JPG PNG presumably
---------------------------
Images can be supported with ease, they can be pulled from other directories, but let's start 
with one in **./source** The same spot as the .rst file doing the calling.

.. image:: rags.jpg 

Note: The extension can be omitted and the packaged tries to find and show the file.
This also works, see the source code if you want to be sure of this, but here it is to encourage
you to use the wild card form:
| .. image:: rags.*

Official documents say the .* find it yourself is preferred so the package 
can pick the best **.ext** for particular renderings. That is, **.jpg .svg .png** with the same filename
is specifically supported.


.. _images2:

More full featured image inclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is a more maximal example. Figures can renumber themselves and be referred to with symbolic names too.
This example is slightly less fell blown then that, however.

.. label:`rocksplatesetc`

.. figure:: happypictures/plates.*
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Dishware
   :align: center

   **This is a picture of some dish stuff**


This is quite simply achieved, using:
  | .. figure:: happypictures/plates.*  
  |   :scale: 50 %  
  |   :alt: Dishware  
  |   :align: center  

  |  \*\*This is a picture of some dish stuff\*\*    
  |

The images are copied and managed into a subdirectory for distribution for you. You
might want to segregate images as per the above example in a subdirectory, 
presumably of **./source**


.. _codeblock1:

A code block specifically tweaked for HTML
------------------------------------------------
Everybody has no choice but to **love** HTML, right ?

.. code-block:: html
  :caption: Blocks of languages etc can have captions too

    <html>
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
    </html>


.. _downloads1:

Offer files for downloads
-------------------------
Download offered files use the dowenload keyword.

:download:`This is a little picture <happypictures/lifter.png>`.

Probably this varies depending on what the file extension is, ( mime type )
and browser settings.

Also remember the export is a STATIC file copy. If you want to point to files
that are dynamic, not part of a publishing action cycle, use URLS outside the 
hierarchy of this published act, or you will serve up stale files.

This program leaves static files; ( but picks thru them with search, and adds the indexes for you ).
Still, remember it makes static files in a fat package. Reaching out around the basket of goods is
completely reasonable.

.. _iframe1:

IFRAME using raw HTML
---------------------
The HTML tage IFRAME is hard to use well. Here it is embedding a UTUBE call: 

.. raw:: html

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UaIvrDWrIWM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Before you implement it, remember securities and so on mean its harder for the user to
'get at' the URLed entity then offering them a click.

Its messy to explain and offer both options .... Consider the user experience, not the ego idea 
your code is in the driver's set ! **But it is there to use**.

Also the **raw** for HTML is probably a general ways to do many cute things. If you plan
to use the set for LaTeX, remember if its HTML only is disappears from paper documents
entirely.


.. _inlinevideo1:

Inline Roles
------------------------------
Inline Asterisk changes for BOLD and Italics are fine but there are more text presentation
mods to apply. The bigger picture way is so called **ROLES** and of course they are inline
with any active text. Like:

| :rolename:`Mary had a little lamb`.

So, substitute the keyword below ( ex. *literal* ), for **rolename** as above, and will get the effect.

**Docutils rules** supports the following roles:

• emphasis – equivalent of *emphasis*
• strong – equivalent of **strong**
• literal – equivalent of ``literal``
• subscript – subscript text
• superscript – superscript text
• title-reference – for titles of books, periodicals, and other materials

So this should make a emphasis :emphasis:`Different` it should be.

Lets look at titles as in: :title-reference:`Aesops Fables` a book about kid stuff.

**REMEMBER** you need the funny backticks, not usual quotes!


.. _footnotes1:

Footnotes
----------
Footnotes are examples of the sort of **improvised syntax** of this markup language. Since you do **want**
to use this fancy stuff, this worked example is important. The ways its communicated here is:
  * Clear example usage
  * Screen shot of the .rst to do it.

Since the place its **called** and where the text is **defined** are in different places dynamically
in the source text, its not so easy to be sure you 'get it', so the screen print will help!

The precedent is nearly identical to our plaintiff's situation [#f1]_ , which might help us in
the proceeding tomorrow.


.. _footnotesmore1:

Elsewhere
~~~~~~~~~
The reference *to* it can be used any number of times, and where it lands in the HTML is here 
the command **rubric* appears

Various presenters like the style in the case discussed yesterday [#f1]_, though it was in a 
different jurisdiction.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] Caulfield versus Baldwin (1994) 96 Cr App R 215.


.. label:`reffootnote`

.. figure:: happypictures/aboutfootnotes.jpg
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: About footnotes

   **This is how Footnotes work**

**Important** Of course usually the last part is at the bottom of a HTML page, like a paper page. 
What is an endnote versus footnote and how this helps re-use in LaTeX needs your attention to detail.


.. _citations1:

Citations
-----------
Citations are quite different looking then footnotes. Documents suggest avoiding Using leading numbers
in the symbol names. Usable as per this example:

The gas giant [Uatrn12002]_, is more active then predicted from the current theory.

.. [Uatrn12002] Q'tahL-1997 Class 7 Gas giant


.. _math1:

Math
-------
Math inclusions:

:math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

There is a more involved way to invoke math inclusions. This is entry level for math stuffola.


.. _abbr1:

Abbreviations
----------------
Abbreviations have specific font support, like:

Like :abbr: `LASER (Light Amplification Stimulated Emission Radiation)`


.. _hhlist1:

Horizontal lists
-------------------
Horizontal lists are easy enough:

.. hlist::
  :columns: 3

  * A list of
  * short items
  * that should be
  * displayed
  * horizontally
  * sorts out nicely

**Important:** Look at the source file carefully to notice the double spaces on each
element. It won't work unless its done like this exactly....


.. _addcolor1:

Adding color
-----------------
The next obvious visual concept to consider is adding color for text, and maybe horizontal lines
like the html tag <hr>.

A subdirectory exists in most of these releases, in **./source** named **addingcolor** with how
to do that. 

Note that formal documents generally do not, (and should not), **require** color to be usable.
Making the 'system', work with color formally, involves stabilizing it as a system, because it
involves add in pieces.  So if there isn't quite a commitment to doing that, its better to avoid
it almost entirely for the moment; Rather then make construction of a little IDE more complex 
for what is not essential. 

The subdirectory is there for a reason... to enable the possibility with (hopefully),
ease. So hack away if you like, but don't drag in a requirement for a frill. 

    I would rather see a B & W image (instead of one with a little color), 
    then an error on the TTY about a missing file I don't quite understand. 
    Or worse, **struggle over a missing file which I can't find**, during a last minute time crunch
    to do a thing!


.. _aboutwho1:

Authorship and versioning
-----------------------------
I had nearly instance success with activating some functionality to neatly add named persons
for 'who did this thing?' controls at the per .rst level. It involves a switch in the conf.py file;
specifically that is variable: **show_authors** and setting it to True enables this neat thing. Of
course, a fussy label line needs inclusion in the .rst too. I wanted it recorded here as an enabling
thing to be known, that it's doable, its easy, and just works.

But it drags in a vast array of subsidiary issues; it's premature to rely on it, so its counterproductive
to do without scoping a decision about who does what where, Id's etc and that is a lot to tangle up
a first instance of a system. Look up the variable in a google search with **Sphinx** and try it if you like.


.. _concu1:

Conclusion
----------
The real official manual for Python is around 500 pages as is kind of comp sci ultra dense, not easy to apply. 
Also, it meticulously integrates hundreds of version control changes for basically obsolete versions.

This file is intended to get you into the ballpark for fancy output without all of that. But its there, for 
you, when you need it.
