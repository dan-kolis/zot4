  <h2>From genotype to phenotype</h2>

How does the information contained within the metagenome of an organism interacting 
with its environment specify behavior and characteristics?

Summary
--------
A fundamental biological challenge is to understand how the information encoded by the
metagenome of an organism is processed to produce the resulting behaviors and phenotypes. 
Simply: genes, made up of DNA, are transcribed into RNA, and translated into proteins 
which together form the vast majority of functional elements in an organism. Evolutionary 
processes ensure that these functional elements interact with their environment in a 
manner that is beneficial to the organism, using a variety of organic (mostly) and 
inorganic molecules to catalyse reactions, recognise cellular signals, build 
cellular structures and pathways, and to perform a host of other diverse biological 
functions.

Our research elucidates these processes by developing computational algorithms to 
model, annotate, and understand the relationships among and between the sequences, 
structures, functions, and interactions of proteins, DNA, RNA, and metabolites, 
from atoms and molecules to systems and proteomes, in the context of their 
environments. The goal is to develop a coherent picture of the mechanistic 
basis (interconnectedness) of molecular and organismal structure, function, networks, 
and evolution within a fundamental scientific framework.

We model interactomics at an atomic level by algorithmic approaches as well as by 
inferring homology (as we have done for the rice proteome and are actively doing 
for the proteomes from 1000 plants), a subset of which is the CANDO compound-proteome 
3D interaction matrix, two applications of which are drug discovery and nanobiotechnology.

Our goals are to develop novel methods and apply them in the following areas:

- Structure: Predict atomic level three dimensional structures of biologically important molecules (such as proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules with emphasis on proteins) given their linear chemical structure (sequence).

- Function: Predict function using the resulting models with the aid of existing experimental information.

- Interaction: Predict interactions between and among these molecules, including biological substrates and inhibitors.

- Systems: Predict the behaviour of pathways, systems, and whole cells by integrating the structure, function, and interaction information with the expression (copy number) of these molecules.

- Evolution: Study the evolution of these biological molecules to ask and answer questions on the origin of, and the conditions necessary to nurture, life.

- Design: Design novel biological entities not observed in nature using our predictive methodologies and verify the designed constructs at the bench.

- Application: Apply the methodologies developed to study specific biological problems of interest in the areas of medicine and nanotechnology.

- Infrastructure: Develop an infrastructure to publish the integrated information so that it is useful for biologists to pose and answer precise scientific questions about molecular, systems and organismal biology.


More detailed information on these methods are available as part of our ongoing research 
and also our list of publications.

Implications
------------
We expect that research into these different bioinformatics disciplines will enable to 
provide a comprehensive mapping and understanding how organismal genomes specify 
phenotype in particular environments. This information will enable us to probe that 
organism's molecular, cellular, and physiological pathways with an exquisite degree 
of sensitivity and also help us understand and treat infectious, neoplastic, 
and inherited disease in an increasingly efficient and rational manner. The development 
of algorithms and tools to understand organismal genomes and proteomes will have 
practical utility for pharmacogenomics and genetic engineering, and will be 
of use to the general research community to pose and answer ever more precise 
biological questions. **Specifically, one of the major applications of our research 
is precision shotgun drug discovery and repurposing using virtual cell multiscale 
models for disease diagnosis and intervention.**

Understanding organismal biology from a genomic and proteomic perspective requires 
expertise in several scientific disciplines, including computing science, mathematics, 
physics, chemistry, and biology. The problems that need to be solved generally 
involve exploration of large search spaces and finding objects of interest within 
those spaces, as well as managing the large amount of data produced and making 
predictions from analysis of the data. Thus our research has significance in not 
only answering biological questions, but is also relevant for solving problems of 
a similar nature in other scientific disciplines.

Long term goals
---------------
Our research involves integrating knowledge from the fields of computing science, 
mathematics, biology, physics, and chemistry to:

- Achieve better understanding of protein structure, protein function, and molecular evolution.

- Analyse genomes and study interactions of individual genes and their corresponding proteins to understand and model their roles in infectious and inherited disease.

- Model complete cellular pathways and systems within an organism of interest using knowledge about the structure of proteins, protein expression, protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions.

- Develop therapeutics and molecular machines to improve human health and quality of life.

- Devise simulations of all forms of life we can observe and others we can imagine.
