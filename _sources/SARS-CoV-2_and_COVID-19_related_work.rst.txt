  Interpreting this data without understanding the context and how the 
  platform works could be hazardous to your health ( literally and figuratively )! 
  
These are a set of initial and preliminary predictions of human approved drugs and 
compounds likely to inhibit the SARS coronavirus 2 (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2). 
..
The predictions were made using the `CANDO <http://protinfo.org/cando>`_ platform.
CANDO works well in expert hands, but these predictions are a first pass application 
optimizing across the SARS proteome first, then using the top scoring methods to 
create predictions against the COVID-19 proteome. 
..
Refinement of the predictions based on considering the protein targets carefully 
is still in progress, and attempts are being made to validate the predictions at 
the bench.

The accuracy of the CANDO platform is between 12%-35% depending on the number of 
compounds evaluated both in terms of retrospective benchmarking and 
prospective in vitro validation ( see :ref:`References` and links below ). 
Indeed, from twelve prospective in vitro validation studies across ten 
indications, 58/163 (35%) top ranking predictions validated using the CANDO 
platform (v1) or its components had comparable or better activity relative to a 
standard treatment (if available, or micromolar or better inhibitors of the pathogenic
system, in this case COVID-19). The validated predictions represent potential novel 
repurposed therapies for indications such as dengue, dental caries, diabetes, herpes, 
lupus, malaria, and tuberculosis. The logic is that since these are compounds generally 
approved for human use, the predictions that are verified in vitro are good candidates 
for off-label use human studies to evaluate efficacy and ultimately, 
represent potential new therapies for a particular indication.

The manifests for each directory corresponding to a particular round of predictions 
are available above. Currently, four lists of predictions were generated using three 
approaches: 
- A homology based approach using known actives against the original SARS-CoV virus.
- A de novo method involving the top predicted binding affinities of approved drugs against structures from the COVID-19 proteome.
- A protein structure agnostic approach using only fingerprint similarities between the SARS actives. The SARS actives were extracted from two high-throughput screens from Shen et al. (2019), Dyall et al. (2014), and an additional broad-spectrum active from Cao et al. (2015).

For the homology based approach ( canpredict-homology-human-all.txt ), our canpredict 
module was utilized in which we tallied the number of times certain drugs/compounds 
were ranked highly in the ranked similarity lists to drugs known to have activity against 
SARS-CoV (38 compounds total, which themselves had a back recovery rate aka accuracy 
of roughly 50%). The set of proteins used for this approach was 5,317 human protein 
structures from the PDB. 
This list includes experimental/investigational compounds selected from a total of 
8,696, including 1,979 approved 
drugs ( `Drugbank <http://go.drugbank.com/>`_ ), 
and only includes 
compounds with a consensus score of at least 2 (second column -> "score1"). 
This same method was used for the protein structure independent method in which 
structural fingerprints were used instead of protein- compound interaction scores 
(ecfp4-2048-bit_vect_tani-cp_human.txt)

For the *de novo* method 
( ecfp10-covid19_coach-int_vect-dice-pscoreXpercentile-CTD1860set-top225.txt ), 
the predictions are based on generating interactions between known drugs and viral 
proteins in a holistic manner: the feature being predicted is really the binding 
or "stickiness" of small molecules to viral proteins. This in turn is expected to 
turn up some inhibitors (of both the proteins and the pathogen) which in turn would 
lead to clinical efficacy. Some of the predictions are obviously incorrect or 
inappropriate, but the unedited output of the software is what is provided; it may 
be possible to refine the predictions further manually. These predictions only include 
drugs with at least one associated indication from the 
`Comparative Toxicogenomics Database <http://ctdbase.org/>`_, which served as a proxy for "approved" status 
(some unapproved drugs are still present, which are indicated by a 'false' in 
the 'approved' column). The March 16, 2020 list of predictions is largely the same as 
the one from March 5, 2020, but only includes approved drugs according to 
DrugBank's mapping (the scoring method is identical).

Some of the interesting predictions from the March 5, 2020 round include 
chloroquine and other antimalarials at rank 35-40 (approach 1), ACE inhibitors at 
rank 19-21 (approach 2), remdesivir at rank 46 (approach 2), and amprenavir and 
other HIV protease inhibitors at rank 48-50 (approach 2), all of which have either 
shown or believed to have efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and are undergoing (multiple) 
clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy. Therefore, some of the other higher ranked 
drugs in our lists are also worth evaluating, with the potential payoff of choice, 
greater efficacy, and reduced cost if shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

Both prediction methods use the same output schema for listing candidates. 

:Column 1 ( 'rank' ): Is Rank of the prediction.

:Column 2 ( 'score1' ): Is the primary score used to rank. In the case of the homology method, this would be the number of times the drug showed up in the topN most similar drugs to the SARS actives. For the de novo method, this is the number of protein interactions above the set threshold. 

:Column 3 ( 'score2' ): Is the tiebreaker score - for the homology method, this is average rank of each of the 'score1' votes (lower is better), while for the de novo method, this is the sum of each interaction above the threshold (higher is better). 

:Column 4 ( 'id' ): Is the in-house ID number assigned to CANDO drugs within the package. 

:Column 5 ( 'approved' ): Is whether or not the drug is FDA approved according to DrugBank; a '*' or '+' indicates that the compound is associated with the query indication according to the input drug-disease mapping (in our case, from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database). The de novo method will include associated drugs for the indication in the output list even if they are unapproved as a reference. 

:Column 6 ( 'name' ): is simply the generic name of the drug/compound.


Methods
********
The publications that describe the CANDO platform in further detail are given below. 
The platform is based on a large number of methods developed by us and by others for 
protein and proteome structure, function, and interaction prediction. In this specific 
case: For the homology based approach rankings, the CANDO platform was used as 
described in the publications except for the changes specified above. For the de novo 
method, eighteen proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome were modelled to obtain 
tertiary structures using I-TASSER. Modelling was accomplished by inferring homology 
to structures in the PDB (typically SARS proteins) determined by x-ray diffraction. 
The CANDO pipeline was used to to obtain predicted interaction scores between these 
eighteen structures and a library of 8,696 small molecule compounds, which includes 
1,860 human ingestible drugs. The compounds with the strongest predicted interaction 
scores ( > 0.9 ) and those that bound the most frequently to these 18 protein 
structures using various scoring protocols are ranked and reported.
