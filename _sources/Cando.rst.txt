Overview
--------
We have a developed a unique computational drug discovery platform based on fragment-based 
docking with dynamics, multitargeting, and drug repurposing to discovery therapeutics with 
higher efficiency, lowered cost, and increased success rates, compared to current approaches.

We have applied this platform to evaluate how every FDA approved and other human ingestible 
drugs and compounds (such as certain phenethylamines, tryptamines, psychoactives, and 
dietary supplements) interact with every protein structure (compiled from a nonredundant 
library of solved protein structures as well as predicted models from various organismal 
proteomes such as Homo sapiens) to identify and rank relationships between them for every 
disease/indication. The compound-proteome interaction signatures are combined with 
pharmacalogical, physiological, and cheminformatics data to predict new therapeutics 
through repurposing drugs already approved for other indications. The top predictions 
are verified in vitro, in vivo, and in the clinic by our collaborators or by contract 
research organisations (CROs).

The project represents a comprehensive integration of our group's applied research 
on therapeutic discovery, building upon basic protein and proteome structure, 
function, interaction, evolution, and design research. Funding sources include 
the National Institutes Health (specifically a 2010 NIH Director's Pioneer Award), 
the National Science Foundation, the Kinship Foundation, the University of 
Washington Technology Gap Innovation Fund, and the Washington Research Foundation.

Indications, collaborations, and current results
We are currently working with almost 30 collaborators throughout the world to find 
cures for over 20 indications/diseases. See a full list of our indications and 
collaborators and some results in progress.

BINDNET Server
We have developed BINDNET, a novel method for predicting likely binding partners 
for a given ligand within a proteome of interest.

Features
Drug discovery is protein folding with a compound.
This section is in progress. There's a lot of novelty to this project, technically 
in terms of the methods used, and also in terms of philosophy and paradigms 
employed (ergo, the reason for the 2010 NIH Director's Pioneer Award). 
Here are a few of them:

Technical
Docking with protein structure + ligand dynamics.
Multitargeting.
Automated binding site identification.
Can be used to computationally assess new compounds from combinations of fragments (+).
Using all the known information about current drug and drug like compounds.
Learning from affinity measures separating entropy and enthalpy.
Predict toxicity through nonspecific binding.
Predict ligand-target networks.
Fragmentation of drugs to identify pharmacophore.
Drug comparisons to substrates and metabolites to find NCEs in the structural context of the binding site
Conceptual/philosophical
Drug profiles across multiple targets (not single drug per target paradigm).
Molecular and systems level integration because of drug profile (i.e., how each compound interacts with the interactome).
Exploiting the fact that all drug discovery thusfar has been a feature of Evolution.
Consolidates almost all one off inhibitor discovery in one shotgun approach.
Systems based drug discovery.
New compounds (+) predicted to be nontoxic can be used to explore beyond the CANDO space for very intractable diseases.
Can be used to create a system of existing and novel small molecules to manipulate living (and nonliving) systems
If successful, it will move compbio frameworks forward unlike never before.
Personalisation
Ultimately the goal is personalisation to improve quality of life, including personalised medicine. When I first came across genetics, my dream was that each person would have their genome sequence and a powerful computing cluster (these days, one can get a personal supercomputer for ~$6000) where they could evaluate the response of their proteins and proteomes (corresponding to their specific genes and genomes) against entities in the environment, such as bioactive chemical compounds, to improve their quality of life, i.e., to treat and/or cure diseases as well develop vaccines. This project is part of that dream and we're going to rigourously evaluate whether it can come to fruition.
