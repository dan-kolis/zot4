Beyond Warming - Improved Weightless food service by repurposing temperatures and sauces
==========================================================================================


A device is proposed to handle pre-prepared and novel cuisine offerings that use 
electronics to control temperature and enhance visual presentation. Heat can be both
added and removed using a semiconductor platen. The range of temperature is bounded
between -15 C and 200 C and the portion size is generally a single adult serving.

Food prepared for using this apparatus in flight has packaging and configuration 
modalities to allow the mix and match of sauces to base meals while retaining layering
familiar in prepared cuisines. The concept of a 'sauce' is extended somewhat to
include layers of additional edible products; In the context of extending the types
of foods and maximizing there appeal possible, the so called sauces are more important 
then there role in ordinary food preparation. 

Opened packages built with stabilized foods, ( using inert gases ) can be subsequently 
chilled to extend there palatable status until enjoyed. 

The innovation involves a single device combining some aspects of a wok, refrigerator, 
oven and table setting into one single user device. 

This is 'Beyond warming'; The viscosity of sauces and their offered surface tension is 
utilized to enable previously hard to provision foods like eggs, pancakes and waffles. 

Well constructed sauces of all sorts supplement water infused vaccum packet portions 
in weightlessness. 

The sauces are provisioned in prepared packages which disappear into the servings, 
they are constructed of casien, an edible milk by-product. 

A longer term agenda is built into a serving controlling apparatus along these lines quite naturally. Locally grown or synthesized products may benefit from reduced temperature. By possibly interfacing to a space heat sinked manifold, energy expenditures can be made trivial.   All sorts of food prep tricks can be folded into the idea. The goal is a pan like closed device of considerable flexibility. But the secret, like the old saying, is in the sauce...

dbk1 A link closest to a real release perhaps
*******************************************
I think this one was posted to my Dan K Cloud thing for a Teleconf show 
and tell on 23 Nov 2020. Since then I fixed some spelling errors, etc; 
And a little first try at versioning too...

:ref:`compBioOp9p63`

Nothing matters as much as the **index.html page** for the first impression, 
so probably its always a sacred, hand fussed over. usually edited a little, file.

This *doesn't* mean its endlessly clobbered, lost and rekeyed.
It means the people doing the work, should decide and do something to make this
compatible with what their doing; For instance: Just setting a 
believed in index.html to **read only**, so its
persists, or have a script copy it over... fixes this issue...

But its a generalized thing to be managed.

**********************
dbk2 Worked examples
**********************
Here's the endlessly tweaked single .rst to .html file of how the compile makes 
effects, and so on:

:ref:`Using_sphinx_worked_examples`

  Note: Its **intentionally** referred with a label, not the heading itself, so
  if you make a boo boo and lose the conf.py file it will stll connect.

    **The conf.py file is important !**

  The worked example file has 'real adult' rev control, the rest of the heap of
  files here doesn't. versioning in conf.py doesn't really seem to be exposed a
  lot in reality. its set to 0.0.1 to imply its not doing anything yet.

In case the conf.py with the id of this work, etc a few changed lines gets lost,
a **backup** file is named: conf.ImaBackupFile


********************************
dbk3 Jump table to alternatives
********************************
Here's a short list of 'top level like' files as links for you to enjoy

**Of course** Titles are duplicated and there are ones with syntax errors 
and "dunno" here and there. There dont have HTML:// yet as there not published
to a real server, but the chaining is the same and local authoring is a lot
more efficient then endless round trips to servers !

*************************************
dbk4 Index XX links of all sorts
*************************************
A heap of bunch of messy tries at the top level indexing concepts:
:ref:`index01`
:ref:`index02`

This is probably a good number of these to leave lurking around 
for thinking and testing.
Just clobber any one you think is stupid or has proved its point 'as you go'.
Of course their in no specific order.

Then the one that's 'really magically right' might be copied over index.html

**OR**

You use some other redirection concept on your server, and its HTML rewrites 
so you generate the right user experience, and leave yourself with one a one line
change for pointing to entire WWW sets, in case of mistakes, ass on fire fixes,
etc.

This is *Not* official version control. its just well, when I did it as they say
in **ISO 9000** it's for **Reference only**, whatever that is suppose to mean
nobody knows exactly...
